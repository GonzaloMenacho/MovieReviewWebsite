# Los Movie Reviews

This project is a movie review website with a basic search engine, developed with CallMiner. 

This project utilizes the Elastic stack to search through thousands of records efficiently, before displaying the results in a custom-made React.JS website. 

The purpose of the project was to gain experience developing software in an Agile workplace, while also learning how to use a popular development framework.

## Installation

This project should be able to be run locally, with the use of Docker and an IDE like Visual Studio.

Currently, only the Elastic backend has been Dockerized, the API and React website will be ran natively.

### Installing Docker

[Follow the instructions here to install Docker Desktop for Windows 10/11.](https://github.com/GonzaloMenacho/StandUpApi/blob/master/docker/README.md)

If you have another way to install Docker, then use the method that works best.

### Install the StandUpApi Repository

[Install The StandUpApi repo,](https://github.com/GonzaloMenacho/StandUpApi) which is needed for the React website to pull data from the Elastic database.

Make sure that this project is linked to the MovieReviewWebsite solution before running, or you won't be able to pull reviews.

### Run the project

The project connects locally using an https connection (using localhost:<port>).
